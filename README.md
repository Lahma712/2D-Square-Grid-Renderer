# 2D-Cell-Grid

This program lets you create 2 2D arrays (horizontal & vertical grid) that contain the data to
create a 2D square cell grid. You can freely choose the resolution of the grid, the number of cells
in width as well as the grid thickness. 

This program is part of my current "Game of life" project.
