# 2D-Cell-Grid

This program lets you create two 2D arrays (horizontal & vertical grid) that contain the data (pixels) to
create a 2D square cell grid. You can freely choose the resolution of the grid, the number of cells
in width as well as the grid thickness. 

This program is a small part of my current "Game of Life" project that I'm working on.
