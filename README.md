# 2D-Square-Grid-Renderer

This program lets you create two 2D arrays (horizontal & vertical grid) that contain the data (pixels) to
create a 2D square cell grid. You can freely choose the resolution of the grid, the number of cells
in width, the grid thickness aswell as the colors (background color and grid color). I visualized the grid with 
<b>PIL</b>.

This program is a small part of my current "Game of Life" project that I'm working on.
